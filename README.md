# morse-coder
User friendly script/tool to morse code encode and decode

Pre-requisite:

Install python modules - 
pip install playsound==1.2.2 
pip install pyttsx3

NOTE: Playsound 1.3.0 creating some conflicts for driver recognize in OS So using 1.2.2 version

Future improvement looking on -
1. Instead of passing text, it should encode and decode morse at runtime
2. Add user-friendly UI for same
